First of all, we would like to welcome you at Catena's community and we invite to make yourself at ease.

As you may know, maintaining a good gaming environment requires constant maintenance and serious involvement into applying efficient updates.

The server is running smoothly at this moment but who knows what the future may bring to us, which is why we're giving the opportunity to any community member to contribute to this server's growth and ensuring an everlasting lifespan.

Those contributions will be used to support the server's cost.
